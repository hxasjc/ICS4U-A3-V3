# ICS4U-A3-V3

A game I created for my ICS4U final project. It is a game where 2 monsters fight each other using a variety of abilities. One monster is controlled by the player and the other one is computer controlled.


## Combat

This game uses a simplified version of the combat system from Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. Both monsters roll for initiative to determine which one goes first. Currently implemented attacks are very simplistic, just dealing one type of damage however I plan to implement a variety of more complex attacks. Zombies also have their "Undead Fortitude" ability which allows them to potentially revive infinitely.


## Monsters

New monsters are pretty easy to add, requiring a simple class, one line of code to ensure the class is loaded, and an optional image. Each monster "rolls" the dice to determine their health and other stats.
